# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This is a project on air quality index prediction. I have applied machine learning algorithms like SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier on the dataset of Indore and Delhi (from 2020 to 2022) . The purpose of AQI prediction is to help people know how the local air quality affects their health.
